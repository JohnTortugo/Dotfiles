Diagnostic highlighting groups

You can change the styling for the highlighting groups YCM uses. For the signs in the Vim gutter, the relevant groups are:

YcmErrorSign, which falls back to group SyntasticErrorSign and then error if they exist
YcmWarningSign, which falls back to group SyntasticWarningSign and then todo if they exist
You can also style the line that has the warning/error with these groups:

YcmErrorLine, which falls back to group SyntasticErrorLine if it exists
YcmWarningLine, which falls back to group SyntasticWarningLine if it exists
Note that the line highlighting groups only work when gutter signs are turned on.

The syntax groups used to highlight regions of text with errors/warnings:

YcmErrorSection, which falls back to group SyntasticError if it exists and then SpellBad
YcmWarningSection, which falls back to group SyntasticWarning if it exists and then SpellCap
Here's how you'd change the style for a group:

highlight YcmErrorLine guibg=#3f0000









You may want to map this command to a key; try putting nnoremap <F5> :YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics<CR> in your vimrc.
